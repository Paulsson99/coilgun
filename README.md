# Coilgun
This project is a part of a Bachelor thesis at Chalmers University of Technology aimed at developing a more energy efficient coilgun. The aim of this project is to find the best values for all the parameters required when building a coilgun, such as coil-length, voltage etc, by using a genetic algorithm. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paulsson99/coilgun.git
```
This will clone the repository to your current folder. To finish the installation download the requriements and install the repository with
```bash
# Change your current directory to the project folder
cd coilgun
# Install the requrements
pip install -r requirements.txt
